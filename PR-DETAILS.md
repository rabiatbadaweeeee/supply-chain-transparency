## Overview

Blockchain-based supply chain transparency system creating immutable records of product movement from origin to consumer, enabling complete traceability and authenticity verification.

## Problem Solved

Global supply chains face critical transparency gaps affecting $25T+ in annual trade:
- 5% food waste due to lack of traceability ($1.25T)
- Billions lost annually to counterfeit products
- Inability to verify product origins
- Regulatory compliance challenges
- Consumer distrust and brand damage

## Solution

Smart contract platform providing:
- **End-to-End Tracking**: Complete product journey documentation
- **Immutable Records**: Tamper-proof movement history
- **Consumer Verification**: Instant authenticity checks via blockchain
- **Quality Assurance**: Track conditions throughout supply chain
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Automated audit trails

## Technical Implementation

### Contract: `supply-chain-tracker.clar`

**Core Functionality** (172 lines):

1. **Product Registration**
   - Register products with unique IDs
   - Record origin and manufacturer
   - Track product type and creation timestamp
   - Initialize custody chain

2. **Checkpoint System**
   - Add supply chain checkpoints (movements)
   - Record location, handler, and timestamp
   - Track checkpoint types (inspection, transfer, etc.)
   - Maintain sequential checkpoint history

3. **Custody Management**
   - Transfer custody between parties
   - Verify current holder
   - Update product status
   - Track custody chain integrity

4. **Verification System**
   - Verify product authenticity
   - Check product existence
   - Confirm current holder
   - Validate supply chain integrity

5. **History Tracking**
   - Get complete checkpoint history
   - Access checkpoints by sequence
   - Count total movements
   - Track product lifecycle

### Data Structures

```clarity
- products: Maps product IDs to origin, type, holder, status
- checkpoints: Tracks movements with location and timestamp
- product-checkpoints: Maps products to checkpoint sequences
- product-checkpoint-count: Counts checkpoints per product
```
